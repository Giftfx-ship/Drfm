      <h2>About Divine Reconciliation</h2>
      <p>
        Divine Reconciliation Faith Ministries began as a small band of faithful worshippers who were hungry for God and
        committed to seeing lives transformed by the power of the Gospel. Today we are a multi-generational fellowship
        that prioritizes the presence of God, the preaching of Jesus Christ, and practical demonstrations of God’s love
        in our city and nation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our weekly services are saturated with passionate praise, fervent prayer, and expository preaching that leads
        people into a deeper knowledge of the Word. We value discipleship, deliverance, and the equipping of saints for service.
        We are committed to training leaders, supporting families, and advancing the kingdom through worship and witness.
      </p>

      <p>
        We welcome everyone: the seeker, the skeptic, the broken, the joyful — all are invited to taste and see that the Lord is good.
        Come and experience an atmosphere of love, healing, and powerful ministry that fuels personal and community transformation.

      <h2>What We Believe</h2>
      <p>
        We believe in one God — Father, Son and Holy Spirit. We believe in the authority of Scripture, the atoning death and
        resurrection of Jesus Christ, and the baptism of the Holy Spirit for empowerment to live a holy and fruitful life.
        We affirm prayer, prophetic ministry, and the exercise of spiritual gifts for the edification of the church.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our doctrine centers on salvation by grace through faith, the sanctifying work of the Spirit, and the expectation of Christ’s return.
        We are committed to sound teaching and the pursuit of holiness, compassion, justice and mercy.
